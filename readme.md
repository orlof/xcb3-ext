# Orlof's XC-Basic3 Libraries for C64 Repository

Welcome to Orlof's XC-Basic3 Libraries repository! Originally created for the xcb-gfx bitmap graphics library, this repository has expanded its scope to encompass a variety of useful libraries for XC-Basic3.

## Contents
- Bitmap Graphics Library: The original graphics library designed for bitmap manipulation.
- Character Mode UI Library: A library facilitating the creation of character mode user interfaces.
- High Performance Random Number Generator Library: Enhance your projects with a high-performance random number generator.

## Future Additions
Expect continuous updates with new libraries derived from the routines employed in my game development endeavors.

## Repository Organization
The main directory hosts all the library files (prefixed with "lib_"), while the examples/ subdirectory provides illustrative code for each library.

## Documentation
Find detailed documentation for each library in the [Wiki](https://github.com/orlof/xcb3-gfx/wiki). Explore and unleash the potential of these libraries in your projects.

## Get Started
Clone the repository, explore the libraries, and have fun integrating them into your XC-Basic3 projects!
