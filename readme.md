# Orlof's XC-Basic3 Libraries for C64 Repository

Welcome to Orlof's XC-Basic3 Libraries repository! Originally created for the xcb-gfx bitmap graphics library, this repository has expanded its scope to encompass a variety of useful libraries for XC-Basic3.

## Contents
- [Bitmap Graphics Library](https://github.com/orlof/xcb3-gfx/wiki/Bitmap-Graphics-Library) ([lib_gfx.bas](libs/lib_gfx.bas))
  - The original graphics library designed for bitmap manipulation.
- [Character Mode UI Library](https://github.com/orlof/xcb3-gfx/wiki/Character-Mode-UI-Library) ([lib_ui.bas](libs/lib_ui.bas))
  - A library facilitating the creation of character mode user interfaces.
- High Performance Random Number Generator Library ([lib_rnd.bas](libs/lib_rnd.bas))
  - Enhance your projects with a high-performance random number generator.
- Joystick Library ([lib_joy.bas](libs/lib_joy.bas))
  - Simple interface for reading the joystick inputs.

## Future Additions
Hopefully new libraries derived from the routines employed in my game development endeavors.

## Repository Organization
- libs/ directory hosts all the library files ("lib_*.bas")
- examples/ subdirectory provides illustrative code for each library

## Documentation
Find detailed documentation for each library in the [Wiki](https://github.com/orlof/xcb3-gfx/wiki). Explore and unleash the potential of these libraries in your projects.
